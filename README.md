During my time at Utah Tech, my passion for certain computer science topics flourished. However, many concepts felt foreign to me, and I often found myself lagging behind peers who seemed to possess a wealth of knowledge. Recognizing the increasing importance of computer science in various fields, I yearned for earlier exposure to these subjects.

Inspired by my journey and the growing significance of computer literacy, I set out to create a solution that would make learning these topics accessible and enjoyable for everyone. Thus, I developed a video game that seamlessly integrates outdoor exploration with fundamental computer science concepts, aiming to ignite curiosity and familiarity among players.

Drawing from my love for classic retro games like Mario and Harvest Moon, I crafted an experience that combines the joy of adventure with engaging learning opportunities. Half of the game features a charming Harvest Moon/Stardew Valley art style, inviting players to explore a vibrant world while overcoming challenges such as fending off animals scattered throughout the environment.

The other half presents a thrilling 2D platformer experience, where players tackle computer science problems in a dynamic and interactive manner. By intertwining gameplay with educational content, the game offers a compelling way to learn and apply key concepts, empowering players to approach challenges creatively and persistently.

In essence, my game seeks to capture the essence of classic gaming experiences while introducing players to the exciting world of computer science, making learning both accessible and enjoyable for all.
## Additional info

### Most of the code is in the Binary/Desert scripts and Assets/Menu folders, although there was some code that had to be placed directly in the Assets folder because of the way that the packages are implemented.

### All the sprites that I made and used are located in the Assets folder
